# Astral Deed
## Introduction
Astral Deed is my first game development project. The intention is to build a competitive card deck based game with themes of astrology inspired by Queen's Blood from FF7: Rebirth. 
The game is built using Haxe Flixel, a game development framework for the Haxe language.
